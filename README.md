# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
This analysis was made to help understand the correlation between the success of campaigns and the launch dates and funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
When looking at the outcomes based on the launch date the data shows that campaigns launched in May have the highest success rate. While June and July have success rates that decrease from May's, it should be noted that they are still above average in their success. It should also be noted that while there are more campaigns launched in May, April shows the lowest number of failed campaigns. Lastly, In December the data shows that the number of successful and failed campaigns are very close in size but December is the only month where the failed campaigns are higher than the successful campaigns. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
When looking at the outcomes based upon the goals of the campaigns the most successful campaigns typically had fundraising goals in the range of one thousand to five thousand dollars. With that being said it is important to note that the largest amount of failed campaigns is also in the goal range of one thousand to five thousand dollars. Thirty-four percent of the campaign goals fell into this category, driving up the percent of success and failed campaigns. The data also shows that when a campaign has a goal of over fifty thousand dollars the success rate plummets while the canceled and failed rates rise. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
As far as challenges in this analysis, I feel the amount of data we started with can prove to be difficult. It's challenging to figure out what the best data to show are when we have so much of it. It also becomes challenging to keep track of the data and stay organized in presenting it. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

The first conclusion I can draw is that campaigns launched in late spring to early summer have the highest success rates. The second conclusion is that campaigns launched after July decrease in their success rates and drop significantly in the winter months. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

My conclusion for the outcomes based on goal amounts is that campaigns with goals in the range of less than one thousand to ten thousand dollars have the highest success percentages. Campaigns with a goal of fewer than one thousand dollars have the highest success rate. While campaigns with higher goals decrease in success.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

Some limitations with this data set are when looking at success rates in the value of goals and time frames for campaigns there is a limitation of the number of campaigns launched in those times. When there are months that have a much higher or lower amount of campaigns launched the data is skewed due to the volume of launch attempts. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

To further present this data I believe we could use a pie chart to represent the success rate of campaigns based on the launch date. We could also use a column chart to display the outcome based on the goal amount of the campaigns.
